# Prelude Reference

The eucalypt **prelude** is a standard library of functions, operators,
and constants that is automatically loaded before your code runs.

You can suppress the prelude with `-Q` if needed, though this leaves
a very bare environment (even `true`, `false`, and `if` are defined
in the prelude).
