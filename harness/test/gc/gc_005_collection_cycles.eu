# GC collection cycles test - Test GC behavior across multiple collection cycles
#
# CURRENT SCALE: 12 objects across 3 waves to test multi-cycle collection behavior
# FUTURE SCALE: 200+ objects across 10+ waves with complex survival patterns

# This test validates GC behavior across multiple collection cycles, ensuring
# objects survive repeated collections and memory management remains stable.

# Each wave creates objects that should survive subsequent collection cycles
