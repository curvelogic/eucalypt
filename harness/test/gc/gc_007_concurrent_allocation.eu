# GC concurrent allocation test - Test concurrent allocation patterns
#
# CURRENT SCALE: 18 objects simulating concurrent allocation patterns
# FUTURE SCALE: 500+ objects with true concurrent allocation simulation
# 
# This test validates GC behavior under simulated concurrent allocation patterns,
# testing allocation bursts that might occur in multi-threaded or high-throughput scenarios.

# Simulate concurrent allocation patterns through rapid bursts
# Each "thread" represents a different allocation pattern happening simultaneously
# TODO: Scale up for true concurrent testing with complex synchronization
