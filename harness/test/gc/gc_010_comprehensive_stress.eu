# GC comprehensive stress test - Final comprehensive stress test combining all scenarios
#
# CURRENT SCALE: 50 objects covering all major GC scenarios for comprehensive validation
# FUTURE SCALE: 2000+ objects with extreme stress testing across all dimensions
# 
# This test combines elements from all previous GC tests into a comprehensive stress
# scenario that validates GC behavior under complex, multi-dimensional workloads.
