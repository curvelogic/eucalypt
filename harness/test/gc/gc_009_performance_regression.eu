# GC performance regression test - Test performance characteristics and regression detection
#
# CURRENT SCALE: 25 objects with basic performance patterns for validation
# FUTURE SCALE: 1000+ objects with complex performance monitoring and regression tracking
# 
# This test validates GC performance characteristics, detecting potential regression
# in allocation patterns, collection frequency, and memory management efficiency.
