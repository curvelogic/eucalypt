Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Mayor - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --wisp --labels=polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\ngt nudge \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck.

{"id":"eu-5si","title":"GC: Implement full reference updating system","description":"## Overview\n\nImplement a complete reference updating system to eliminate forwarding pointer indirection overhead after object evacuation.\n\n## Problem\n\nAfter object evacuation (when implemented), objects will use forwarding pointers for redirection. While functional, this approach has performance overhead:\n\n- **Performance overhead**: Following forwarding pointers adds indirection cost\n- **Memory overhead**: Forwarding pointers remain until next collection  \n- **Complexity in mutator**: All object access must handle forwarding\n\n## Solution\n\nImplement a reference updating phase that traverses the object graph after evacuation and updates all references to point directly to new locations, eliminating forwarding pointer traversal.\n\n## Technical Challenges\n\n**Architectural Constraint**: Requires mutable access to root objects, but current `collect()` function signature takes immutable references:\n\n```rust\n// Current signature\npub fn collect\u003cT: GcScannable\u003e(heap: \u0026mut Heap, roots: \u0026[\u0026T], clock: \u0026Clock)\n\n// Required signature  \npub fn collect\u003cT: GcScannable\u003e(heap: \u0026mut Heap, roots: \u0026mut [\u0026mut T], clock: \u0026Clock)\n```\n\nThis requires:\n1. Changing the `collect()` signature to take mutable roots\n2. Updating all call sites throughout the codebase\n3. Implementing reference update traversal for all object types\n4.

Content Preservation**: Preserve string literals, comments, section headers during formatting\n\n**R2. Dot Spacing Fix**: Fix `a . b` → `a.b` (remove spaces around dots, preserve decimal numbers)\n\n**R3. Colon Spacing Fix**: Fix `name : value` → `name: value` (remove space before colon in declarations)\n\n**R4. List Comma Spacing Fix**: Fix `[a,b,c]` → `[a, b, c]` (add space after commas)\n\n**R5. Block Spacing Fix**: Fix `{a:1}` → `{ a: 1 }` (add spaces inside braces)\n\n**R6. Line Breaking**: Break long lines when they exceed configured width\n\n**R7. Tab Detection and Reformatting**: Detect tabs and trigger appropriate handling (see R26)\n\n### Alignment and Indentation Requirements\n\n**R8. Good Alignment Preservation**: Preserve intentional alignment patterns when using spaces\n\n**R9. Excess Whitespace Normalization**: Normalize excess whitespace (5+ spaces) in single-line blocks to single spaces\n\n**R10. Blank Line Preservation**: Preserve blank lines in multi-line blocks\n\n**R11. Nested Block Indentation Preservation**: Don't modify proper indentation in nested blocks\n\n**R12. Consistent Indentation**: Indentation should be consistent multiples of indent_size\n\n### Semantic and Context Preservation\n\n**R13. Semantic Preservation**: Preserve semantic differences like `f(x)` vs `f (x)` \n\n**R14. Well-Formatted Code Detection**: Don't reformat code that's already well-formatted\n\n**R15. Conservative Spacing**: Only fix spacing violations, don't change user formatting choices\n\n### Advanced Formatting Logic\n\n**R16. Smart Line Breaking**: When breaking lines, break at logical boundaries (operators, natural grouping points)\n\n**R17. Context-Aware Indentation**: Line breaking should account for existing indentation in nested contexts\n\n**R18. Nesting Level Tracking**: Each nesting level should account for accumulated indentation\n\n### Tab Handling\n\n**R26. Tab-to-Space Alignment Conversion**: \n- Tab characters are always wrong and constitute misalignment\n- If tabs can be determined to be intended for alignment (by assuming tab width of 2 or 4 chars), reproduce the alignment using appropriate number of spaces\n- If tabs can't be \"legitimised\" as intentional alignment, trigger full reformatting of the appropriate level node\n\n## Design Notes\n\nThe implementation should support two distinct formatting modes:\n\n1. **Conservative Mode**: Fix spacing violations while preserving good formatting\n2. **Full Reformatting Mode**: Generate well-formatted output from scratch for any AST node\n\nWhen violations are detected that warrant reformatting (tabs, bad alignment), switch to full reformatting mode for that entire node subtree.\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"162815+gmorpheme@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-17T11:58:05.237161Z","created_by":"eucalypt_private/crew/koala","updated_at":"2026-01-20T10:59:15.733604Z","closed_at":"2026-01-20T10:59:15.733604Z","close_reason":"Superseded by epic eu-4oe with detailed task breakdown","external_ref":"gh-64"}
