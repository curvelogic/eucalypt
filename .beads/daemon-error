LEGACY DATABASE DETECTED!

This database was created before version 0.17.5 and lacks a repository fingerprint.
To continue using this database, you must explicitly set its repository ID:

  bd migrate --update-repo-id

This ensures the database is bound to this repository and prevents accidental
database sharing between different repositories.

If this is a fresh clone, run:
  rm -rf .beads && bd init

Note: Auto-claiming legacy databases is intentionally disabled to prevent
silent corruption when databases are copied between repositories.
