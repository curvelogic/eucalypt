# Imports

Eucalypt supports importing content from other units in a variety of
ways.

Imported names can be scoped to specific declarations, they may be
made accessible under a specific namespace, and they may be imported
from disk or direct from git repositories.

## Import scopes

Imports are specified in declaration metadata and make the names in
the imported unit available within the declaration that is annotated.

```eu

{ import: "config.eu" }
data: {
  # names from config are available here
  x: config-value
}

```

As described in [syntax](syntax.md), declaration metadata can be
applied at a unit level simply by including a metadata block as the
very first thing in a eucalypt file:

```eu
{ import: "config.eu" }

# names from config are available here

x: config-value

```

## Import syntax

Imports are specified using the key `import` in a declaration metadata
block. The value may be a single import specification:

```eu
{ import: "dep-a.eu"}
```

or a list of import specifications:

```eu
{ import: ["dep-a.eu", "dep-b.eu"]}
```

The import specification itself can be either a *simple import* or a
*git import*.

### Simple imports

Simple imports are specified in exactly the same way as *inputs* are
specified at the command line (see [command line](command-line.md)).

So you can override the format of the imported file when the file
extension is misleading:

```eu
{ import: "yaml@dep.txt" }
```

...and provide a name under which the imported names will be
available:

```eu
{ import: "cfg=config.eu" }

# names in config.eu are available by lookup in cfg:

x: cfg.x
```

In cases, where the import format delivers a list rather than a block
("text", "csv", ...) a name is mandatory:

```eu
{ import: "txns=transactions.csv" }
```

Simple imports support exactly the same inputs as the command line,
with the proviso that the stdin input ("-") will not be consumable if
it has already been specified in the command line or another unit.

### Git imports

Git imports allow you to import eucalypt direct from a git repository
at a specified commit, combining the convenience of not having to
explicitly manage a git working copy and a library path with the
repeatability of a git SHA. A git import is specified as a block with
the keys "git", "commit" and "import", all of which are mandatory:


```eu
{ import: { git: "https://github.com/gmorpheme/eu.aws"
			commit: "0140232cf882a922bdd67b520ed56f0cddbd0637"
			import: "aws/cloudformation.eu" } }
```

The `git` URL may be any format that the git command line expects.

`commit` is required and should be a SHA. It is intended to ensure the
import is repeatable and cacheable.

`import` identifies the file within the repository to import.

Just as with simple imports, several git imports may be listed:

```eu
{ import: [{ git: ... }, { git: ... }]}
```

...and simple imports and git imports may be freely mixed.
