# Eucalypt evolution proposals — toward v1.0 and beyond

- **Status:** Draft portfolio for review
- **Date:** 2026-06-01
- **Baseline:** eucalypt 0.7.0 (type-system Stage A shipped in 0.6.2; Stage B + HKT shipped in 0.7.0)

This directory collects the strategic proposals for how eucalypt should
evolve over the next few minor versions on the road to **1.0**, and where it
should head afterwards. They are written to be reviewed *as a set* when
deciding the next stages of the language's evolution after 0.7. Each is an
argument, not a commitment; each is sized to be read in one sitting (~2,000
words) and to support a yes / no / defer decision.

For how the documents are written, see [`_house-style.md`](_house-style.md).
For a recommended ordering across releases and the dependencies between
proposals, see [`SEQUENCING.md`](SEQUENCING.md). For high-priority **fixes** to
land before/alongside these proposals (surfaced during review, written
bead-ready for import), see [`0000-priority-fixes.md`](0000-priority-fixes.md).

## Why now, and why these

Eucalypt is a **tool first** — for generating, templating and transforming
YAML/JSON/TOML — and a lazy, pure, functional language second. Its peers are
configuration/data languages (Jsonnet, Dhall, CUE, Nickel, Pkl, KCL, Starlark),
not general-purpose languages. It already has a great deal: a gradual type
checker with higher-kinded types (0.7.0), a rich LSP, an Immix-style GC, an STG VM, a tree-sitter
grammar, and editor support.

Two facts shape this portfolio:

1. **The type-system roadmap is now largely shipped.** Stage A landed in
   **0.6.2** (`Dict`, equirecursive types, literal types, flow narrowing,
   `NonEmpty`, first-class alias references) and Stage B + **HKT** in **0.7.0**
   (`Con`/`App` kinds, HKT-typed `monad()`, dependent indexed access, the prelude
   type cache, `Partial(T)`, full row inference, structural operator
   constraints). The nineteen-hypothesis
   [`type-system-evolution.md`](../development/type-system-evolution.md) and its
   [`type-system-bead-plan.md`](../development/type-system-bead-plan.md) are now a
   *delivered* plan, with a sketched Stage C ("radical options") remaining. These
   proposals therefore **build on a shipped type system**, and engage the seven
   open questions the maintainer left in §5 of that document — several of which
   the delivered work now informs.
2. **The largest gaps are not in the type system.** There is no definition of
   what "1.0" commits to; no package/module system beyond file imports; no
   doc-generation; no concurrency story; an unresolved O(n)-block / GC-finalisation
   wall (ADR-001); and an uncached ~500–700 ms compile latency that is the most
   *visible* performance problem. Most of the whitespace proposals live here.

Every proposal honours the **non-negotiables** (see `_house-style.md` §1):
syntactic conservatism, structural-over-nominal, gradual/inference-first, the
single-threaded lazy-pure runtime, the tool-first framing, and UK English.

## The portfolio

`Class`: **E**xtends-roadmap · **W**hitespace · **F** Stage-C fork · **P**rocess.
`★` marks the highest-leverage items for 1.0.

**Bench (alternates that can swap in):** debugging a lazy language (DAP /
value-provenance); streaming & large-data scaling; distribution & packaging
(nixpkgs / Homebrew / WASM CDN); homoiconicity & macros; first-class type
values; algebraic effect-rows.

**Planned additions (not yet drafted):** an **alternative-backends** proposal —
core→WASM compilation and other execution targets — is forthcoming. These are
genuinely independent implementations, so they are the consumer of 0003's
conformance contract; they also interact with
[0008](0008-parallel-evaluation.md) and [0019](0019-host-language-interop.md).

## How these engage the maintainer's seven open questions

(from [`type-system-evolution.md`](../development/type-system-evolution.md) §5)

| Open question | Addressed mainly in |
|---|---|
| 1. Is "no nominal" inviolable? | 0011, 0001 (export contracts) |
| 2. Is the metadata type-DSL acceptable indefinitely? | 0013 |
| 3. Encourage user-defined monads (pulls in HKT)? | 0011 |
| 4. How much do we care about runtime performance? | 0004, 0005, 0006, 0007 |
| 5. Invest in algebraic subtyping (MLsub)? | 0012 |
| 6. Policy on boundary unsoundness? | 0002, 0009 |
| 7. Is typing the metadata channel worth it? | 0009, 0013 (revisits the won't-do) |

## Reading order

- Deciding **what 1.0 *is***: 0001 → 0002 → 0003.
- Deciding **whether the runtime is 1.0-ready**: 0004 → 0005 → 0006, then the
  forks 0007 → 0008.
- Deciding **how far the language goes**: 0009 → 0011 → 0010, with the 0012
  and 0013 forks.
- Deciding **the adoption surface**: 0014 → 0015 → 0016 → 0017 → 0018 → 0019.

`SEQUENCING.md` proposes a concrete release-by-release ordering.
